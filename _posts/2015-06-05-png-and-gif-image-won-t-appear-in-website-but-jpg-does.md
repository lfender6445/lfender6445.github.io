PNG and GIF image won't appear in website but JPG does


My website is atomicscroll.com.

In the atomicscroll directory, I have a subdirectory called 'img'. In this subdirectory, I have three files: as.gif, as.png, as.jpg.

[http://atomicscroll.com/img/as.gif](http://atomicscroll.com/img/as.gif) doesn't work. The same address with as.png doesn't work either.

But [http://atomicscroll.com/img/as.jpg](http://atomicscroll.com/img/as.jpg) works just fine.

This behavior is consistent across Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Can someone tell me why this would be?

Thank you for your help.

its because the format of your image is jpg. if you want it to be a .gif file you must create or convert the jpg to that format. if the file is already there, make sure you match the file extension exactly as it appears.
