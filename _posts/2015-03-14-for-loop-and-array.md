For Loop and Array


    var brackets = [];
    for(i = 0; i < 5; i++){
  brackets.push(15 += 5)
    }

I want to use this code to add a new element to the array each time, but the new elements have to be added in increments of 5, starting from 15. It will go 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.


--------------------------------------- 
    var brackets = [];
    for(var i = 15; i < 45; i+=5){
  brackets.push(i);
    }
