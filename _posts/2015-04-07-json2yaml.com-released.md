# [www.json2yaml.com released](http://www.json2yaml.com)

Proud to announce the completion of [http://www.json2yaml.com](json2yaml.com) - its been a month long project that I've attempted to keep as simple but flexible as possible.

I am a huge fan of YAML and have come to grow wary of JSON over the years for its rigid and ceremonious data structures. Sure, it supports out of the box browser support, but both data formats have large adoption rates and portability in the programming world. YAML is slim and elegent, ships with a robust spec and set of features, and while not as fast as JSON in terms of parsing, foresakes performance in lieu of simplicity.

i encourage the use of YAML wherever practical and possible. Check out the project and let me know what you think!
