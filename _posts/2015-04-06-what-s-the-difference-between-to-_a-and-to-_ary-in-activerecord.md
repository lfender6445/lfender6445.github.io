What's the difference between to\_a and to\_ary in ActiveRecord?

What's the difference between `ActiveRecord.to_a` and `ActiveRecord.to_ary`?

---------------------------------------
to\_a, when called on an object returns an array representation of obj

Examples

{% highlight ruby %}
class Example
  def initialize
    @str = 'example'
  end
end
a = Example.new #=> #<Example:0x105a74af8 @str="example"
a.to_a #=> [#<Example:0x105a6a3a0 @str="example">]
{% endhighlight %}

Hash Example

{% highlight ruby %}
h = { "c" => 300, "a" => 100, "d" => 400, "c" => 300 }
h.to_a #=> [["c", 300], ["a", 100], ["d", 400]]
{% endhighlight %}
> An array can also be created by using the Array() method, provided by Kernel, which tries to call to\_ary, then to\_a on its argument. [http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html#method-i-to\_ary](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html#method-i-to_ary)

so as far as I can see, the Array#to\_ary src just returns the array that is passed in, as in

{% highlight ruby %}
def to_ary
  return self
end
{% endhighlight %}

if I understand correctly, to\_a is used for array conversion and makes its final return using to\_ary. But this may not be true in future versions according to apidock

> to\_a Returns an array representation of obj. For objects of class Object and others that donâ€™t explicitly override the method, the return value is an array containing self. However, this latter behavior will soon be obsolete. [http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/to\_a](http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/to_a)
